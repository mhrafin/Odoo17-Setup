# System Update

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

# Install Necessary Packages

```

# Check the PostgreSQL version

```
psql --version
```

Remember the version.

## Start PostgreSQL main cluster

If the version of PostgreSQL was 16.2 or any 16.x or any version like 14.x, use the whole INT number.

```
sudo pg_ctlcluster 16 main start
```

This starts a PostgreSQL database cluster (version 16(or whatever is installed in your machine), main cluster) with administrative privileges.

# Create a new Linux user account

```
sudo useradd -m -d /opt/odoo17 -U -r -s /bin/bash odoo17
```

>**[!] If you decide to use any other name other than 'odoo17' then remember to use that on future commands where I use 'odoo17'. Because the linux user name and the postgresql database user name, that we are going to create later needs to be the same to be able to connect odoo to the database.**

Here,

`-m`: Creates the user's home directory if it doesn't exist

`-d /opt/odoo17`: Sets the home directory path to `/opt/odoo17` (non-standard location)

`-U`: Creates a group with the same name as the user and adds the user to that group

`-r` Creates a system account:

- This creates a "system account" instead of a regular user account
- System accounts are meant for running services or programs, not for human users
- They typically have lower user ID numbers (usually below 1000)
- They often don't show up in login screens or user lists
- Think of it like creating an account specifically for a program (in this case, Odoo) rather than for a person

`-s /bin/bash` Sets the user's login shell to bash:

- This sets which program runs when the user logs in
- `/bin/bash` is the standard command-line interface (shell) on many Linux systems
- This means the odoo17 user can use normal terminal commands if someone logs in as that user
- Without this, the account might be limited in what it can do when logged in
- It's useful for troubleshooting or manual maintenance of the Odoo service

# Create a new PostgreSQL database user

This command creates a PostgreSQL superuser named "odoo17" by temporarily becoming the Postgres system user.

```
sudo su - postgres -c "createuser -s odoo17"
```

Here,

`su -` switches to another user with a login shell environment
`postgres` is the target user, which is the PostgreSQL system user. (Auto created during postgresql installation.)

`-c "createuser -s odoo17"` - This executes a command as the postgres user:

- `createuser` is a PostgreSQL utility to create new database users
- `-s` flag gives the new user superuser privileges in PostgreSQL. The superuser privilege is significant because it allows the odoo17 user to create databases, roles, and have unrestricted access to all databases in the PostgreSQL server.
- `odoo17` is the name of the user being created

# Downloading wkhtmltopdf .deb file

```
wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6.1-2/wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-2.jammy_amd64.deb
```

## Install wkhtmltopdf

```
sudo apt install ./wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-2.jammy_amd64.deb -y
```

# Switch to odoo17 Linux user account

```
sudo su - odoo17
```

## Clone odoo17 repo

This command is downloading the latest code from the Odoo version 17.0 branch, without its commit history, and placing it in the `/opt/odoo17/odoo` directory on your system.

```
git clone https://www.github.com/odoo/odoo --depth 1 --branch 17.0 /opt/odoo17/odoo
```

`--depth 1`: This flag creates a "shallow clone" with a history truncated to only the most recent commit. Instead of downloading the entire commit history (which can be large), this only gets the latest version, saving bandwidth and storage space.

## Change directory to

```
cd /opt/odoo17
```

## Create a Python virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv odoo-venv
```

## Activate the Python virtual environment

```
source odoo-venv/bin/activate
```

### Install wheel

```
pip3 install wheel
```

### Install Odoo's requirements

```
pip3 install -r odoo/requirements.txt
```

### Change directory to Odoo cloned repo

```
cd /opt/odoo17/odoo
```

### Start Odoo

```
./odoo-bin
```

Odoo is now running on localhost:8069 unless the port 8069 is already is in use.
Check localhost:8069. **DO NOT DO ANYTHING YET**.

### Stop Odoo

 Press `ctrl + c` to stop Odoo.

## Deactivate Python venv

```
deactivate
```

## Make directory for custom Odoo addons

```
mkdir /opt/odoo17/myapps
```
## Create Odoo Config file
```
sudo nano /opt/odoo17/odoo/odoo.conf
```
> If you want you can create this file anywhere in the system after exiting odoo17 linux user acc. Just remember to point to that path where you saved your odoo.conf file when needed.

Paste the below code there, **Remember to change the admin_passwd to something good**.
```
[options]
; The ; means the command is commented out.

; Specify the password that allows database management:
admin_passwd = admin_passwd

; db_host = False
; db_port = False
; This is the odoo17 postgresql database user we created earlier.
db_user = odoo17
; db_password = False

addons_path = /opt/odoo17/odoo/addons,/opt/odoo17/myapps

; This is the default port. It is specified here as you will want to set this if you are running Odoo on an alternate port.
; xmlrpc_port =8069

; This is the default longpolling port. Like the xmlrpc_port we are specifying this port for completeness
; longpolling_port = 8072

; If you plan on setting up nginx it is advised to specify multiple workers in the configuration. If you donâ€™t set this to workers > 1 then you could run into problems when you specify the long polling blocks in the nginx config file.
; workers = 1

; You will want to add a dbfilter to your config file if you have more than one database. Remove the ; and specify the database so that your Odoo installation knows exactly which database to use for the instance.
; dbfilter = [your database]
```
# Exit odoo17 Linux user account

```
exit
```
