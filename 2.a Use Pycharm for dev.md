# Install Pycharm

Follow the instruction from this [Link](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html).

Now that pycharm is install in your linux system user account. Lets Continue,

## Some things to clarify

Lets say we installed pycharm on userA on our Linux System. Previously, we set up odoo with odoo17 system account not as a user account. So normally userA won't be able to see whats inside odoo17 account's home directory (opt/odoo17/) without sudo.

And pycharm being installed in userA cannot also access those files. So to get around this we will add userA (meaning our user account) to the group of odoo17(which is also odoo17).
To check which groups your current account is in try this,

```
groups
```

We also need to edit pg_hba.conf file. Its PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File. We will be trying to connect to the database user we created earlier (odoo17) with our normal everyday Linux user account. So both of their names now don't match, at this stage it won't let us establish connection because its set to 'peer'. We are going to change it to 'trust' which will allow the connection unconditionally. **THIS IS ONLY FOR DEVELOPMENT**. We could also set this to md5 but would require us to add a password to the odoo17 database user and also include that password on the odoo.conf file under db_password field.

Read more on pg_hba.conf, [Link](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

## Add to odoo17 group

Just `whoami` command shows which user we are currently in. Here, use that user's name with which you are going to use pycharm (Normally the one you installed pycharm with). Typically its the one you normally login to the system with.

```
sudo usermod -a -G odoo17 $whoami
```

Adding your user to the odoo17 group, it doesn't give the odoo17 user any of your sudo privileges. The odoo17 user still runs with limited privileges. The Odoo service itself will still run as the restricted odoo17 user.

**After successful. RESTART THE PC. And after restart check if your User account has the group odoo17 on them with `groups` command**.

## Give permission to group members

```
sudo chmod -R 770 /opt/odoo17
```

Changing permissions to 770 means:

- The odoo17 user (owner) has full access
- Members of the odoo17 group (including you now) have full access
- Others have no access

## Edit pg_hba.conf

To locate where this pg_hba.conf file is, use this `locate pg_hba.conf`. To use 'locate' command you need to install plocate, `sudo apt install plocate -y`

- Copy the first location. It probably looks like this, `/etc/postgresql/16/main/pg_hba.conf`
- Sudo nano into the file,

```
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/16/main/pg_hba.conf
```

- Find this line in the file scrolling down, (I suggest read the file if possible)

```
local   all             all                                     peer
```

- change 'peer' to 'trust'
- Press ctrl + o then press Enter key to save. Press ctrl + x to exit.
- Restart postgresql service and reload daemon and again restart postgresql service.
```
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

# Open odoo17 folder

Open the "opt/odoo17/" folder on pycharm.

## Set python interpreter

After opening the odoo17 folder on pycharm, if it doesn't detect interpreter specifically from `opt/odoo17/odoo-venv/bin/python` (We created this previously) then first try restarting, if it still doesn't get the interpreter from there then add the interpreter located in (`opt/odoo17/odoo-venv/bin/python`) manually.

# Create a configuration

- Go to `Run > Edit Configuration` from the navbar of pycharm.
- Click on the '+' sign and select python. On the script field select the odoo-bin file located in  `/opt/odoo17/odoo/odoo-bin`
- On Script parameters field add the conf you created earlier. Like this, `-c /path/to/your/conf/file.conf` . Those who followed the instructions copy paste this,

```
-c /opt/odoo17/odoo/odoo.conf
```

- Set the working directory to `/opt/odoo17/odoo/`
- keep everything else as is and click apply and close.
