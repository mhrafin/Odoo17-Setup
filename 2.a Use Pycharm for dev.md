# Install Pycharm

Follow the instruction from this [Link](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html).

Now that pycharm is install in your linux system user account. Lets Continue,

## Some things to clarify

Lets say we installed pycharm on userA on our Linux System. Previously, we set up odoo with odoo17 system account not as a user account. So normally userA won't be able to see whats inside odoo17 account's home directory (opt/odoo17/) without sudo.

And pycharm being installed in userA cannot also access those files. So to get around this we will add userA (meaning our user account) to the group of odoo17(which is also odoo17).
To check which groups your current account is in try this,

```
groups
```

## Add to odoo17 group

Just `whoami` command shows which user we are currently in. Here, use that user's name with which you are going to use pycharm (Normally the one you installed pycharm with). Typically its the one you normally login to the system with.

```
sudo usermod -a -G odoo17 $whoami
```

Adding your user to the odoo17 group, it doesn't give the odoo17 user any of your sudo privileges. The odoo17 user still runs with limited privileges. The Odoo service itself will still run as the restricted odoo17 user.

**After successful. RESTART THE PC. And after restart check if your User account has the group odoo17 on them with `groups` command**.

## Give permission to group members

```
sudo chmod -R 770 /opt/odoo17
```

Changing permissions to 770 means:

- The odoo17 user (owner) has full access
- Members of the odoo17 group (including you now) have full access
- Others have no access
