# Install Pycharm
Follow the instruction from this [Link](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html).

Now that pycharm is install in your linux system user account. Lets Continue,

## Some things to clarify,
Lets say we installed pycharm on userA on our Linux System. Previously, we set up odoo with odoo17 system account not as a user account. So normally userA won't be able to see whats inside odoo17 account's home directory (opt/odoo17/) without sudo.

And pycharm being installed in userA cannot also access those files. So to get around this we will add userA (meaning our user account) to the group of odoo17(which is also odoo17).
To check which groups your current account is in try this,
```
groups
```
## Add to odoo17 group
